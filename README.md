## About Me
I'm a Computing and Data Science junior at Sai University, Chennai. I intern at NetoAI, an AI for telecom startup and do NLP research with the Financial Services Innovation Lab at Georgia Tech. 
I was one of the five students from India to be chosen to participate in the ! [Global Undergraduate Exchange Program] (https://www.worldlearning.org/program/global-undergraduate-exchange-program/), in which I was awarded a full-ride scholarship to pursue one semester of undergraduate study in Computer Science in the United States.
